\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:org5ba7d53}
In conventional power saving techniques, the user has to be vigilant
in turning ON/OFF electrical loads as and when required. This ensure
optimal consumption and reduce power bill for the consumer. This
effort can be automated and optimized better. This project will enable
the user to control loads from anywhere as long as the mobile device
and the Raspberry Pi (@ home) are connected to Internet.  

The intention is to retrofit this system into the existing domestic
wiring scheme of the user with minimal changes as much as possible.

\subsection{Purpose of this document}
\label{sec:org6d773d9}
The purpose of this document is to list down the design specification
and design details for this home automation project. 

\subsection{Objectives}
\label{sec:orgab614ed}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The project will enable users to switch electrical loads through a
mobile application
\item The load ON/OFF times shall be logged. This logged information can
be used to provide the user with suggestions for power saving.
\item Power factor correction for inductive loads and switching in/out
"tank circuits" shall also be done based on the load conditions
\item \ldots{}.
\item \ldots{}\ldots{}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Design}
\label{sec:orgc8df6f2}

\section{Wiring scheme}
\label{sec:org5d4759e}
In the conventional power switching arrangement, the following
modifications should be made to implement this design. The SPST switch
used conventionally to switch ON/OFF loads, should be replaced with a
DPST switch (commonly known as "two-way" switch). A relay with DPST
switching arrangement should be connected to the new DPST switch. This
two-way switch wiring scheme established by the new two-way switch and
the DPST portion of the relay allows the user to switch ON/OFF loads
either from the two switch or by microcontroller. The relay shall be
driven by a Arduino microcontrolller. The wire leading to the load
from the relay contact shall have an ACS712 (Hall effect sensor)
connected in series before the load. The pupose of the Hall effect
sensor is to measure the current drawn by the load. The output of the
Hall effect sensor shall be wired as input to one of the analog
channels of the Arduino controller.  The wiring drawing is presented below

\section{High level block diagram}
\label{sec:org78a47c7}
The following portions shall make up this design
\begin{enumerate}
\item Wiring scheme with modified switch, relay and Hall effect sensor
\item Arduino (Micro) micro controller
\item Raspberry Pi
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Arduino micro controller}
\label{sec:org30fb435}
The microntroller will be able to see the ON times of all the loads if
either they are switched via the controller itself or directly by the
DPST switch. This information is logged at the microntroller level and
passed on to Raspberry Pi. 

Provided the Arduino is able to communicate directly to a server over
the internet, then all data analysis and HMI functions can be passed
on to application in the server machine. Data can be pulled over the
network to a mobile device to control and perform HMI functions.
\subsection{Raspberry Pi}
\label{sec:org19a7111}
\subsubsection{HMI}
\label{sec:org7e244bf}
The Pi is responsible for pulling all the data logged by the
microcontroller and present it on screen for the user to review. The
Pi functions like an HMI. A small 7" touch enabled screen could be
wired to RPi to enable users to control loads and view reports locally
\subsubsection{Data analysis}
\label{sec:orga0498b6}
The next function of Pi is to do statistical analysis of the logged
information. This analysis will come out with results that could
provide suggestions to the user with load profiles. This report will
tell the user how much power was consumed by respective loads. It will
also present the normal ON times of the load during a day. Based on
this data, the user can take an informed decision about turning OFF
loads at certain time of the day.
